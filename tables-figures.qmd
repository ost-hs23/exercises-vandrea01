```{r}
#| warning: false
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-asp: 0.618

ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                     y = bill_depth_mm,
                     color = species,
                     shape = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_colorblind() +
  labs(x = "Bill length (mm)", y = "Bill depth (mm)") +
  theme_minimal()
